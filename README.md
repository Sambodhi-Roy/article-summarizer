# AI Article Summarizer

This project is an AI-powered article summarizer built using **React**, **Vite**, **Tailwind CSS**, **Redux** for article summarization. The application allows users to paste URLs, and it generates a concise summary of the content using GPT-4, a powerful language model from OpenAI, accessed through RapidAPI.

## Features

- **AI-based Article Summarization**: Automatically summarizes long articles and web pages into shorter, more digestible summaries using GPT-4.
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-friendly interface built using Tailwind CSS.
- **State Management**: Efficient state management using Redux for managing application states like user inputs, fetched summaries, and loading status.
- **Fast Development with Vite**: Vite provides an ultra-fast development environment for React.
